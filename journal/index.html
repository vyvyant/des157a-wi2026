            <p>When I encounter websites that use images and interaction, I tend to slow down and take my time to digest the information and content on the page. While reviewing the "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" article, it mentioned that viewers tend to notice more intricate details, and that these visual exercises “help expand their knowledge of and curiosity about the world in addition to making them more visually literate.” Many of the photos presented in the article made me pause reading and instead start analyzing the images more closely.</p>
            <p>I believe one drawback of websites that rely heavily on images and interaction is that they can sometimes distract users from the most important information on the page. While text can feel boring, when it is organized clearly and not too bulky, it can still maintain users’ attention. Additionally, excessive imagery can affect performance and load times.</p>

            <p>For example, when I access the Awwards website, it often takes several seconds for all content to fully load. Each time I click on a header or subheader, there is a noticeable delay before the page finishes loading. While the visuals are inspiring and encourage visual exploration, the interaction can sometimes interrupt the overall experience, especially for users on slower devices or connections.

            <h2>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h2>

        <article>
            <p>The key takeaways I took from the “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes” article by Nielsen Norman Group, is that overlays can be problematic only if they are misused.</p>
            <p>Depending on how the overlay is used, it is only ideal to use an overlay if the content in the overlay is urgent or to confirm a user’s actions. When overlays are used without careful intention- it may lead the user to click off the page or become frustrated. Overlays also often break on mobile devices, and make it harder for users to achieve a certain task if there are too many overlay interruptions.</p>
            <p>A good example of an overlay is a confirmation popup before submitting a payment. This type of overlay helps the user double-check their action, without disrupting the overall experience.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
                <p>In the “Best practices for form design” article, one of the practices that best stood out to me is utilizing the less is more theory. Most users leave a form or a website because of its long checkout process, or the amount of information it has. I often apply this principle when creating usability surveys in Google Forms by carefully considering the types of questions I ask and keeping the overall form length manageable, such as using short but meaningful open-ended questions.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting thing I learned from this article was to use size fields accordingly. Whenever I design input fields, I tend to make all input fields in a form the same size. I thought that if the input fields were the same size, it would look more consistent and symmetrical. However, the article explains that varying input field sizes can act as an affordance, helping users understand how much information is expected in each field, which ultimately improves usability.
</p>
<p>
The third practice that resonated with me was explaining why sensitive information is required. When I read this, it reminded me of previous times whenever I stopped filling out a form or exited a website whenever they would ask for sensitive information. Most of the time, whenever a website asks for sensitive information, I usually consult someone for advice whether or not I should enter that said information. To solve that problem, the article mentions to add support text close to the input field so users wouldn't click off of the form. 
</p>
<p>
A website or form that I believe exemplifies these best practices is Google’s account sign-up form. The onboarding uses minimal required fields, intentional sized input boxes, and explanatory text for sensitive information like passwords. The process felt straightforward and trustworthy.
