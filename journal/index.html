            <p><figure> <img src="images/ear.png" alt="Piercing Image" style="width:100%"> <figcaption>Fig.1 - Piercings Photo by Anjali Ravi.</figcaption> </figure></p>

                <p><figure> <img src="images/drawing.png" alt="drawings Image" style="width:100%"> <figcaption>Fig.2 - Drawings Photo by Nisha Sahota.</figcaption> </figure></p>
                
            <p><b><em>What is the images about? What are the most interesting aspects of the image/s? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.</em></b><br>The image is about Anjali's piercings, and the different kinds she has on her ear. It’s interesting that besides the visible ear piercings, she also has other piercings. Like on her face, or a stomach piercing as well. When I look at this image, I immediately think that she’s trying to tell a story about using piercings as some means of self-expression.</p> <p>In <b>fig.2</b>, it is about Nisha’s love for drawing, and the nostalgia it brings. The drawings in the image were drawings she had done as a child. Whats interesting is the lighting she used to capture the photo, its almost as if the pages of her drawings are glowing and prominent. She also contrasts her black and white pencil drawing, with a colored one below it. I think it made the drawings a lot more eye-catching when she placed those two together. Theres also a small piece of text above, which makes me think she liked doing some story-telling, or imagined the future a lot as a child too.
</p>
</p>

            <p><b><em>What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of the image?</em></b><br>One thing that is obvious in this picture is that she prefers to wear hoop style earrings. I'm curious about the dangling earring that she is wearing, and whether or not there is a significance to that, or if she prefers wearing dangly/hoop earrings over wearing a stud one. Or if there's a possibility that she prefers wearing jewelry that is more flashy, or stands out more.</p><p> In <b>fig.2</b> the most obvious aspect of the image is that there are drawings visible in the image. A mysterious aspect of the images is whether or not the order of layout means anything. Why did they include a quote that they wrote as a child? And why did the choose to include these drawings?
</p>

            <p><b><em>What are your suggestions to push the visual thinking and the narratives with the image/s to make them less ordinary or documentive and more expressive, poetic, intriguing, mysterious, or otherwise visually rich.</em></b><br>
               In <b>fig 1.</b> if she has an organized case of all of the earrings she has, whether that's for the ears or other body parts- I think it would be interesting to have the viewer guess what piercing is for what, and what she is trying to say with her collection. She could place her daily jewelry on a flat plane surface. She could pretend there is a human body drawing on the plane (or placing an actual drawing), and she can organize the jewelry to match a placement of where the piercings would go to. If the surface is empty & only shows the jewelry, then viewers can guess what the relevance of the piercings are, and what the placement means. </p><p>In <b>fig 2.</b> they could include a photo of themselves doing something while they are drawing, or something that is happening to them. Something that makes people wonder, “What’s going on in this picture?” The photo could include them drawing while they’re in a zelda costume (they previously told me they loved zelda as a kid, and zelda is super nostalgic to them), which would definitely leave people wondering what is happening in that photo. 
            </p>

            <p><b><em>Why and how is this image interesting for your image in Figure 3? Tell us something we would not know by looking at the image alone. How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</em></b>
                
                <br>I like the image of where it shows the window, and laptop. It relates to my current topic because it's something simple but important for me to see whenever I’m stressed or tired. Whenever I’m working or studying, as long as I’m near a window, I get re-energized being near some kind of natural lighting. It's also nice that whenever I get to watch people or take a few minutes to relax and think of nothing. Being able to slow down and be in the moment when I stare out of a window reminds me to be more present. That life isn’t just about finishing an assignment.

            <p><b><em>How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?</em></b><br>I think my collection shows what mundane things keep me sane in everyday life, especially when I’m stressed. Everybody does different things to keep themselves afloat, so what I show is something personal to me.

                
            
            
            </p>


            <p><b><em>How could you consider updating the images themselves to make them more compelling? </em></b><br> I think if I took images of flowers that I have that are alive + wilted, it would leave the viewer wondering if I collect old flowers, whether they have a certain meaning to me, or if I regularly buy flowers for myself as a treat. I think I could frame my photos in a more interesting way, where the viewers could think there is something more than what the eye sees.

            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>When I encounter websites that use images and interaction, I tend to slow down and take my time to digest the information and content on the page. While reviewing the "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" article, it mentioned that viewers tend to notice more intricate details, and that these visual exercises “help expand their knowledge of and curiosity about the world in addition to making them more visually literate.” Many of the photos presented in the article made me pause reading and instead start analyzing the images more closely.</p>
            <p>I believe one drawback of websites that rely heavily on images and interaction is that they can sometimes distract users from the most important information on the page. While text can feel boring, when it is organized clearly and not too bulky, it can still maintain users’ attention. Additionally, excessive imagery can affect performance and load times.</p>

            <p>For example, when I access the Awwards website, it often takes several seconds for all content to fully load. Each time I click on a header or subheader, there is a noticeable delay before the page finishes loading. While the visuals are inspiring and encourage visual exploration, the interaction can sometimes interrupt the overall experience, especially for users on slower devices or connections.

            <h2>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>The key takeaways I took from the “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes” article by Nielsen Norman Group, is that overlays can be problematic only if they are misused.</p>
            <p>Depending on how the overlay is used, it is only ideal to use an overlay if the content in the overlay is urgent or to confirm a user’s actions. When overlays are used without careful intention- it may lead the user to click off the page or become frustrated. Overlays also often break on mobile devices, and make it harder for users to achieve a certain task if there are too many overlay interruptions.</p>
            <p>A good example of an overlay is a confirmation popup before submitting a payment. This type of overlay helps the user double-check their action, without disrupting the overall experience.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
                <p>In the “Best practices for form design” article, one of the practices that best stood out to me is utilizing the less is more theory. Most users leave a form or a website because of its long checkout process, or the amount of information it has. I often apply this principle when creating usability surveys in Google Forms by carefully considering the types of questions I ask and keeping the overall form length manageable, such as using short but meaningful open-ended questions.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting thing I learned from this article was to use size fields accordingly. Whenever I design input fields, I tend to make all input fields in a form the same size. I thought that if the input fields were the same size, it would look more consistent and symmetrical. However, the article explains that varying input field sizes can act as an affordance, helping users understand how much information is expected in each field, which ultimately improves usability.
</p>
<p>
The third practice that resonated with me was explaining why sensitive information is required. When I read this, it reminded me of previous times whenever I stopped filling out a form or exited a website whenever they would ask for sensitive information. Most of the time, whenever a website asks for sensitive information, I usually consult someone for advice whether or not I should enter that said information. To solve that problem, the article mentions to add support text close to the input field so users wouldn't click off of the form. 
</p>
<p>
A website or form that I believe exemplifies these best practices is Google’s account sign-up form. The onboarding uses minimal required fields, intentional sized input boxes, and explanatory text for sensitive information like passwords. The process felt straightforward and trustworthy.
