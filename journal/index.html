                <p>In the “Best practices for form design” article, one of the practices that best stood out to me is utilizing the less is more theory. Most users leave a form or a website because of its long checkout process, or the amount of information it has. I often apply this principle when creating usability surveys in Google Forms by carefully considering the types of questions I ask and keeping the overall form length manageable, such as using short but meaningful open-ended questions.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting thing I learned from this article was to use size fields accordingly. Whenever I design input fields, I tend to make all input fields in a form the same size. I thought that if the input fields were the same size, it would look more consistent and symmetrical. However, the article explains that varying input field sizes can act as an affordance, helping users understand how much information is expected in each field, which ultimately improves usability.
</p>
<p>
The third practice that resonated with me was explaining why sensitive information is required. When I read this, it reminded me of previous times whenever I stopped filling out a form or exited a website whenever they would ask for sensitive information. Most of the time, whenever a website asks for sensitive information, I usually consult someone for advice whether or not I should enter that said information. To solve that problem, the article mentions to add support text close to the input field so users wouldn't click off of the form. 
</p>
<p>
A website or form that I believe exemplifies these best practices is Google’s account sign-up form. The onboarding uses minimal required fields, intentional sized input boxes, and explanatory text for sensitive information like passwords. The process felt straightforward and trustworthy.
