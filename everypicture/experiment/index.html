          <p class="overlay-title">Natural lighting</p>
          <p class="overlay-body">Whenever I need a boost of energy while studying, I always look to sit in front or next to a window with natural lighting. Even at home, I always prefer natural lighting over white lights.</p>

          <p class="overlay-title">A Sweet Drink.</p>
          <p class="overlay-body">Treating myself with a drink, or going to a cafe to study always adds a different change of pace to my routine. I always get a boba or a latte on the weekends whenever I'm out with my friends, family, or anyone I care about.</p>

          <p class="overlay-title">Agenda.</p>
          <p class="overlay-body">Having a physical or digital agenda really helps me jot down what I need to do for the day. It helps me stay organized, reminds me to do any tasks I forget to do, and focus on what's important. Having a some type of structure helps me be less overwhelmed.</p>

          <p class="overlay-body">Watching any type of cooking vlog, whether its in a documnetary form, vlog, or travel show- its always intesrting and helps me relax and focus on something thats not academic or work related. I love listeniing to decompress during inbetween walks to class to decompress, or just to have fun & vibe.</p>

          <p class="overlay-title">Flowers</p>
          <p class="overlay-body">I always find myself to stop and look at flowers whenever I pass by any. I never usually get any for myself because of cost & the fact that they eventually wilt, but I always take a second to admire and appreciate their beauty. It reminds me to be present in the moment and notice the small things in life.</p>
